# Carina: Your Software Architect üöÄ

## What is Carina?

Carina is an AI-powered tool that helps you design software architecture. By walking you through a series of thoughtful, strategic questions, it helps you clarify your vision, identify potential challenges, and create more robust architectural designs. Asking the right questions is often more important than having immediate answers. The tool's name comes from the Keel constellation (Carina in Latin), which represents the strong central beam that runs along a ship's bottom to support its entire structure - much like how this tool serves as the backbone of your software design process.

## Before You Begin: What You'll Need üõ†Ô∏è

### Technical Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **Node.js and npm**: These help run the frontend of your application

### Beginner's Tip üí°

If you're new to programming, don't panic! This guide will walk you through everything step-by-step.

## Let's Get Started! üåü

### Step 1: Download the Project

A directory is just another word for a folder on your computer. Before downloading the project, you'll need to choose which folder you want to store it in.

1. Open your terminal (also called Command Prompt on Windows)
2. Navigate to the folder where you want to store the project using these commands:

```bash
# For example, to go to your Downloads folder:
cd ~/Downloads    # Mac/Linux
# or
cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads    # Windows

# Not sure which folder you're in? You can check by typing:
pwd    # Mac/Linux
# or
cd     # Windows

# Once you're in the right folder, run this command to download the project:
git clone https://github.com/lod-io/Carina.git

# This will create a new folder named 'Carina'. Let's move into it:
cd Carina
```

Note: Replace `YourUsername` with your actual Windows username. For example, if your username is "John", you would type: `cd C:\Users\John\Documents`

### Step 2: Set Up the Backend (Python Part)

#### Create a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment is like a special room for your project's Python packages. It keeps everything organized!

```bash

# Go to the server folder
cd server

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate    # Mac/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
```

#### Install Required Packages

```bash
# This installs all the Python libraries the project needs
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Get Your API Key

1. Visit [CL≈çD Console](https://dashboard.clod.io/api-key)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Under "API Keys", click "Generate +" to create a new API key
4. Copy your API key

#### Create an Environment File

Create a file named `.env` in the `server` folder and add your API key:

```bash
# Create and open the .env file in your default text editor
touch .env
nano .env
```

Type or paste the following into the file:

```bash
CLOD_API_KEY="[your-api-key]"
```

Save the file by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

### Step 3: Set Up the Frontend (Web Interface)

```bash
# Move to the client folder
cd ../client

# Install web dependencies
npm install
```

## Running the Application üñ•Ô∏è

### Start the Backend Server

1. **Navigate to the Server Folder**:

   ```bash
   cd ../server
   ```

2. **Launch the Backend**:

   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

   Leave this terminal window open to keep the backend running.

### Start the Frontend

1. **Open a New Terminal Window**: You need a separate terminal to run the frontend.

2. **Navigate to the Client Folder**:

   ```bash
   # If you're starting from the project root folder:
   cd client

   # If you're starting from anywhere else:
   cd path/to/Carina/client

   # For example, if you're in the server folder:
   cd ../client
   ```

3. **Start the Web Interface**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will launch the frontend, and you can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How to Use the Application

Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

## Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Module Not Found Error**

  - Make sure you've activated the virtual environment
  - Confirm all requirements are installed

- **Backend Won't Start**

  - Double-check your `.env` file
  - Ensure your API key is correct and properly formatted

- **Frontend Fails**
  - Verify all npm dependencies are installed
  - Check for any error messages in the terminal

## Pro Tips üí°

- Always keep your virtual environment activated when working on the project
- If you close your terminal, reactivate the virtual environment
- Don't share your API key publicly

Happy Coding! üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª
