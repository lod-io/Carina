# Carina: Your Software Design Assistant üöÄ

## What is Carina?

Carina is an AI-powered tool that helps you design software architecture. By walking you through a series of thoughtful, strategic questions, it helps you clarify your vision, identify potential challenges, and create more robust architectural designs. Asking the right questions is often more important than having immediate answers. The tool's name comes from the Keel constellation (Carina in Latin), which represents the strong central beam that runs along a ship's bottom to support its entire structure - much like how this tool serves as the backbone of your software design process.

## Before You Begin: What You'll Need üõ†Ô∏è

### Technical Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **Node.js and npm**: These help run the frontend of your application

### Beginner's Tip üí°

If you're new to programming, don't panic! This guide will walk you through everything step-by-step.

## Let's Get Started! üåü

### Step 1: Download the Project

Open your computer's terminal (or command prompt):

```bash
# This downloads the project to your computer
git clone https://github.com/lod-io/Carina.git

# Move into the project folder
cd Carina
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Backend (Python Part)

#### Create a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment is like a special room for your project's Python packages. It keeps everything organized!

```bash
# Go to the server folder
cd server

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# For Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Install Required Packages

```bash
# This installs all the Python libraries the project needs
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Get Your API Key

1. Visit [CL≈çD Console](https://dashboard.clod.io/api-key)
2. Click "Generate +" to create a new API key
3. Copy your API key

#### Create an Environment File

Create a file named `.env` in the `server` folder and add your API key:

```bash
CLOD_API_KEY="[your-api-key]"
```

### Step 3: Set Up the Frontend (Web Interface)

```bash
# Move to the client folder
cd ../client

# Install web dependencies
npm install
```

## Running the Application üñ•Ô∏è

### Start the Backend Server

```bash
# Go back to the server folder
cd ../server

# Launch the backend
python3 main.py
```

### Start the Frontend

```bash
# Go to the client folder
cd ../client

# Start the web interface
npm start
```

## How to Use the Application

Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

## Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Module Not Found Error**

  - Make sure you've activated the virtual environment
  - Confirm all requirements are installed

- **Backend Won't Start**

  - Double-check your `.env` file
  - Ensure your API key is correct and properly formatted

- **Frontend Fails**
  - Verify all npm dependencies are installed
  - Check for any error messages in the terminal

## Pro Tips üí°

- Always keep your virtual environment activated when working on the project
- If you close your terminal, reactivate the virtual environment
- Don't share your API key publicly

Happy Coding! üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª
